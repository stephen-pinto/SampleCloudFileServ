# SampleCloudFileServ
A sample project for learning CPP with Azure cloud storage.

The idea is to create a local copy of the cloud files and track its storage.

###  Normally the steps would go as below:
- User downloads the azure container
- Now he can update it as required
- Once updated he will call 'sync'
- This will check for modifications in the respective files
- Accordingly will upload latest changes on azure
